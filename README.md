# PDF-Dark-Mode-No-GUI-
Same as GUI version but does not let you choose the directory, instead it converts all PDF's in the current directory

Same dependenies too

This version is much more reliable than the GUI verison at the moment. 

USAGE
________________________________________________________________

Put this in the same directory as your PDF's and in the terminal type 'python pdfdarmode_nogui.py'
